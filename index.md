## Overview

Many gamers at the University of Hawai ªi (UH) often struggle to find other players for their favorite games, organize gaming sessions, or discover local gaming events that match their interests. Existing platforms can be too broad or too specific, making it hard to build a consistent, local gaming community. This means missed chances for social interaction, competitive fun, and finding new gaming experiences right here on campus.

Gamers Connect is a user-friendly web application designed to solve this. It helps UH gamers easily find and connect with peers, set up gaming sessions, and discover local gaming events like tournaments and meetups. Users create a profile specifying their gaming interests, preferred platforms, and playstyles. By combining user-generated content with smart matching, Gamers Connect streamlines connections and keeps students informed about all the gaming action relevant to them at UH.

## User Guide

This section provides a walkthrough of the Gamers Connect user interface and its capabilities.

### Landing Page

This is the first thing users see. It introduces Gamers Connect, highlights its main benefits (like finding teammates or events), and has clear options to sign up or log in.

### User Dashboard (Home Page)

After logging in, users land here. It shows a personalized feed with:
* **Recommended Players:** Other UH gamers they might want to connect with based on shared interests
* **Upcoming Sessions:** Any gaming sessions they're part of or new ones relevant to them
* **Local Gaming Events:** A quick look at tournaments or meetups happening at UH or nearby
* **Community Posts:** Recent updates from their gaming groups

### User Profile Page

This is where users manage their gaming identity. They can:
* List their preferred games, platforms, and playstyles
* Set their location (e.g., "UH MƒÅnoa Campus")
* Add a short bio and link to external gaming profiles like their Discord handle
* Adjust their notification settings

### Find Players & Groups

A dedicated page where users can search for other gamers or public groups. They can filter by game, playstyle, and even proximity (helpful for finding people on campus).

### Browse Events

A comprehensive directory of all listed local and online gaming events. Users can filter by game, type of event (tournament, meetup), and date.

### Game Pages

Individual pages for popular games showing a list of active players for that game and related upcoming events.

### Example Use Cases

**Finding a Valorant Teammate:** A new user signs up for Gamers Connect. In their profile, they select "PC" as their platform, "Competitive FPS" as their playstyle, and add Valorant as a primary game. Their User Dashboard immediately shows "Players Online" for Valorant who match their competitive preference. They send a connection request to a player with a similar profile, who accepts. They then coordinate a gaming session by connecting on Discord, which they found on the other player's profile.

**Discovering a Campus Tournament:** A user logs into Gamers Connect. Their User Dashboard highlights an "Upcoming Local Events" section. They see a "Valorant Tournament at the University of Hawaii iLab" listed. The user clicks on the tournament, views the details like date, time, and the registration link, and decides to attend.
